### Clone

Before cloning this repository, please notice two things: first, this repository does not contain generated sources, and second, the Eclipse update site is hosted in the `gh-pages` branch. That being said, my advice is to clone each branch separately; this avoids compiling the sources everytime you checkout the `gh-pages` branch. Additionally, this makes cloning the `master` branch lighter.

To clone the `master` branch:
```bash
git clone -b "master" --single-branch https://github.com/unicesi/amelia
```
To clone the `gh-pages` branch:
```bash
git clone -b "gh-pages" --single-branch https://github.com/unicesi/amelia p2-repository
```

### Compiling From Sources

If you want to build the Amelia sources locally, you need Maven.

First of all, make sure to increase memory

```bash
export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"
```

And then run

```bash
mvn install
```

#### Using Amelia as a Stand-alone Library

The maven artifacts generated by `mvn install` expect Pascani and Xtend lib to be present in the execution environment. In order to use Amelia as a stand-alone library, you need to compile the library project using:

```
cd maven/org.amelia.dsl.lib
mvn package -Pstand-alone-jar
```

You can then use the file `org.amelia.dsl.lib-<version>-dependencies.jar` from the `target` folder.
