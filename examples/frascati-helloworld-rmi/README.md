# FraSCAti helloworld-rmi

This example compiles and executes the helloworld-rmi project from the FraSCAti distribution. It requires specifying the following parameters:

- __host__: the host name to install docker and run the container
- __user__: a user to open the SSH connection to the host

By default, the project pom defines these parameters as follow:

- host = localhost
- user = ${user.name} # the user running maven

To run the example:

1. [Package and install the language artefacts](/README.md#compiling-from-sources)
2. Execute the Java application generated by the Amelia compiler:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dhost=... # specify here the rest of the parameters
```

If everything ran correctly, you should see the following message:

```
Client process running on PID <number>
```
